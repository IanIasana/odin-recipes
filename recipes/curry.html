        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Head to your spice rack to make this butter chicken curry, a dish that symbolises Indian food for millions of people all over the world</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>800g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>Coriander leaves</li>
                    <li>Finley sliced red onion</li>
                    <li>Basmati Rice</li>
                    <li>Chutney</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix all of the marinade ingredients together in a large mixing bowl with 1½ tsp salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix together until well-coated, then cover the bowl and chill for 1 hr or overnight in the fridge.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. Transfer the chicken pieces to a large baking tray (discard any remaining marinade), and cook for 10-15 mins. Turn the pieces after 10 mins so they colour evenly on both sides. The chicken doesn’t need to be completely cooked through at this point as it will cook for a few more mins in the sauce.</li>
                </ol>
